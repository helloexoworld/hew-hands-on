title: Rediscover the known universe with NASA dataset
---

An hands-on used at differents tech conferences, such as BreizhCamp, Devoxx France and so on. You can also do it online!

## Why?

For many years humanity has been exploring the skies, dreaming of interstellar voyages and new planetary colonies. And you, do you want to go with us to discover the universe?

It turns out that NASA has a great public dataset, especially one that is used to search for exoplanets, that is, planets outside our solar system. What if you could search for exoplanets by your own?

## What are the objectives of this tutorial?

At the end of this workshop, you will:

* Learn about [Warp10]({{ site.doc_url }}), a platform designed to collect, store and manipulate sensor data.

* learn about a NASA mission called Kepler

* learn about time-series

* learn WarpScript, a language designed to manipulate time-series

## Directives

During this tutorial, you will have the role of a trainee exoplanet hunter in it's seven learning stages. At the end of each step, the guiding tour will lead you to the next one. For each step, you can direcly write your code online, without the need to install anything. At the end of each step, you will find solutions.

## Where to start?

There is several possibilities depending of your exopanet hunter skills:

* To start with a short resume of what is an exoplanet, you can start with our [step 0](./step-0-Exoplanets-and-where-to-find-them).

* To start with a short resume of WarpScript start with our [step 1](./step-1-WarpScript/1.1-Getting-started-with-WarpScript/).

* To skip this WarpScript initiation and start working on the Nasa Kepler mission data start with our [step 2](./step-2-Keplers-Data/2.1-Did-you-said-Time-Series/).
